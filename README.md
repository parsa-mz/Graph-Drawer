Find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Maximum matching in a graph With Steps !


## Summary 
1. Give edge and vertex count 
2. draw your graph 
3. See MST or maximum matching for the graph

for MST you can choose from Prim and Kruskal algorithms.



## Installation
This project uses ```pygame``` and ```pygame_gui``` for graphics.
If you don't have them installed it will automatically install them.

For this you must have [Python](http://python.org/) installed.


## Customization
You can change theme by adding themes to theme.json file or use one of pygame-gui's default themes.


## Algorithms

- Maximum Matching:

    For maximum matching code uses Edmonds' Blossom algorithm to find maximum matching in general graph 

- Minimum Spanning Tree:

    For finding the minimum spanning tree code uses Prim and Kruskal algorithms.
